Snort Messages in Notification Center
=====================================

`snort-notify` is a simple Mac OS X bash script that monitors a [Snort](https://snort.org/) log file and displays a notification when a new alert is detected.

# Installation

Copy the `snort-notify` script into `/usr/local/bin` and `io.lokd.snort-notify.plist` into your `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` folder (i.e. in your home directory), then log off and log in again or reboot to start it.

The script assumes that your Snort alert log is in `/var/log/snort/alert`.

You will have to adjust the `LOGFILE` setting in the script if it is somewhere else.

# Test It

To test if it works, just trigger an alert, for example by sending an HTTP `POST` request with the body set to `'1'='1` (an SQL injection attempt) from an external IP address to your local web server or using an IDS test.
